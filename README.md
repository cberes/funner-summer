> Have more fun this summer! Funner Summer suggests fun activities for you based on a number of factors: weather, activity history, time, day, and whether you are alone or with a group. Great for winter and snowy weather, too!

Funner Summer is an Android app that recommends fun activities. There is also a back-end component that acts as a proxy to a [weather service](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## Get the app

You can find the app in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.seabears.funner.summer).

## History

I created this app in 2014, back in the times of Android KitKat. Originally the proxy weather service was a Java web service using Jersey, Spring, and Hystrix. It was way too complicated, but that's the technology I was using at the time.
